## Laravel Security Component

### Very alpha and unstable!

Looking for a way to integrate Symfony Security Core in Laravel (http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/security/authorization.html)

Mainly the Voters, for access checking

Includes a ServiceProvider and a Facade, for now simply to add a token using Auth::user() and checking if user is authenticated and roles. It is possible to add voters.
